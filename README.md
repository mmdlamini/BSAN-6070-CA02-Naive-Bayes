# BSAN-6070-CA02-Naive-Bayes

The data set can be downloaded via google drive:\
("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OjBLUaEt-ySWHMQDEU9Q2KVeNR0OUena?usp=sharing")

Upon downloading the dataset, we created python notebook for our further 
analysis.
# Code

# Instructions on how to launch Notebook
I. Open the python notebook on google colab.\
II.  Mount the Google Drive: drive.mount("/content/drive")\
III.  Link the working directories:

**test = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab_Notebooks/test-mails'**\
**train = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab_Notebooks/train-mails'**

IV. Run the Code
V. The last section in the code displays the accuracy score

# Procedures

In order to create our model we followed the following steps:\
I. Acquiring/Downloading the Dataset\
II. Uploading of the Dataset into Google Drive\
III. Mounting the drive to our google colab python notebook\
IV. Importing the Necessary Packages (os,numpy,Counter,GaussianNB,accuracy_score)\
V. Reading the Dataset\
VI. # Defining a function with 3000 most common words from all emails\
VII. # Defining a function which extracts feature columns and populates their values\
VIII. Calculating accuracy scores for predicting labels\
IX. Observations and Findings from the output
